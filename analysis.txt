----- Defuse Section -----

Phase 1: - Consider what you are about to do
Phase 2:   1 6 11 16 21 26 
Phase 3:   5 -972
Phase 4:   6 Duke_Leto
Phase 5:   aepkma
Phase 6:   563
Phase 7:.  20

----- Description Section -----

Phase 1: Compares the input to a given string. If the strings do not match, it explodes. 

Phase 2: Reads in 6 numbers and checks if these 6 numbers are in increasing order with a difference of 5 between consecutive numbers. 
         Otherwise, it explodes.

Phase 3: This phase has a predetermined sequence of arithemtic calculations, either adding or subtracting, and the number of calculations
         done is determined by the value of the first input (a number between 0 and 5). The second number of the input must equal the answer of
         the resulting calculation. 

Phase 4:


A Code section that gives your notion of the C code that is equivalent to the machine code in Phases 5 and 6.
